It's been just over a year since we launched whatleads.to, the simple web app for collaborative planning. High time for a brand new blog!

We didn't have a birthday party when we turned 1, as we've been busy for the last few months working on a super exciting new project - A partnership that's set to change the way organisations measure their social impact. We can't say too much else right now, but watch out for a big announcement from us in October.

In the meantime, Saff's going to be writing on this blog about how people are using whatleads.to. We'll also use this space to fill you in on what we're up to, and anything else we happen to be thinking!
