It's been just over a year since we launched whatleads.to, the simple web app for collaborative planning. High time for a brand new blog!

We didn't have a birthday party when we turned 1, as we've been busy for the last few months working on a super exciting new project - A partnership that's set to change the way organisations measure their social impact. We can't say too much else right now, but watch out for a big announcement from us in October.

In the meantime, we'll be blogging a lot more frequently from now on, about how people are using whatleads.to, what we're up to, and anything else we happen to be thinking!
